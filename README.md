Medical Assistance Chatbot
This project involves creating a medical assistance chatbot using the AI Medical Chatbot Dataset from Hugging Face. The chatbot is fine-tuned using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques for efficient training and is intended for integration with the Gemini API (integration details to be added).

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a medical assistance chatbot capable of interacting with users by providing medical information and advice based on input queries. The chatbot is trained on a specialized medical dialogue dataset and fine-tuned using LoRA to optimize training efficiency.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
GPU with CUDA support (recommended for training)
Basic understanding of NLP and Transformer models
